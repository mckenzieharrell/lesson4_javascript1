### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how may functions that allow calculations to be made to multiple categories on Cloud9.
2. I learned how to work a calculator and how important it is to make each calculation the same but different depending on which calculation I am trying to make. 
3. I also learned about the parseFloat input which can convert String to a Float. This was fascinating because I had not learned about parseFloat before.
